Welcome to Quake 2 Fishin, a mod that lets you fish in Quake 2. To play, add the files in the "mod files" folder to a folder within your Quake 2 file. Then, set your game to the file name. This should allow you to experience this mod!

In this game, use the fish command and the corresponding item number (if you have it/want to use it) to fish. After this, wait for an alert (the inventory tab) to appear, and press the space bar to catch the fish. If you wait too long the fish will escape and you will lose the item used.

In this game there are 5 upgradeable stats: Lure which increases rarity of fish and removes chance to lose a fish, Luck which gives the chance to catch a second fish, Employment which gives 5 dollars each turn based on employment level, Inventory which increases the number of fish you can hold, and Strength which increases the time before a fish escapes.

There are also 5 single use items: Chum, Strong Hook, Long Line, Strong Line, and Premium Bait. These will all be used to help catch special fish.

The fish available in this game and their stats are as follows:

Minos: Worth 1 dollar, Low lure level, Can lose player 1 Employment level
Cod: Worth 5 dollars, Low-mid lure level
Trout: Worth 10 dollars, Low-high lure level
Cod: Worth 20 dollars, Low-high lure level
Salmon: Worth 25 dollars, mid-high lure level
Great White: Special fish, only attracted using Chum, Worth 350 dollars, can increase Employment by 1
Tiger Fish: Special fish, attracted using Strong Hook or high Lure level, Worth 400 dollars
Blobfish: Speciall fish, attracted using Long Line, Worth 100 dollars, increases Inventory by 3
Whale Shark: Special fish, attracted using String Line, Worth 200 dollars, can increase Strength by up to 5
Angel Fish: Special fish, attracted using Premium Bait, Worth at least 175 and at most 275, increases Luck by 1

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy my mod :3
